<p>  
The Student Advisory Council for the City of Ann Arbor aims <br> 
to diversify perspectives within the Ann Arbor community by <br>
discussing local issues amongst active youth members and <br>
presenting our perspectives to the Ann Arbor City Council. Our <br>
organization was established on January 17, 2017. Since then, <br>
we have expanded our efficiency, ideas and membership. We <br>
discuss prominent issues in our community that affect students <br>
and the youth such as public safety, student-community relations <br>,
city housing and homelessness, etc. Our council consists of a wide <br> 
variety of members including students from Ann Arbor area schools, <br>
students appointed from the University of Michigan Rakham Student <br>
Government and students appointed from the University of Michigan <br>
 Central Student Government.
